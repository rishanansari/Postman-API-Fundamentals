**An API Platform**

Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs.

Working with APIs then and now: cURL vs. Postman
Before Postman, it was common practice to poke at APIs with a command line tool for making HTTP requests called cURL. This tool is still used today but has its limitations when it comes to collaboration and sharing. 

API calls with curl
This is an example of what an API call in the terminal using the curl command looks like. Here we are fetching data about GitHub user postmanlabs

curl https://api.github.com/users/postmanlabs

API calls with Postman
Here is the same call done with Postman. Postman shows the response with clean indents and colors and allows you to save, organize and share your requests. You can also see all the components of the request and response broken down into tabs and other helpful details like the response time and status code.
