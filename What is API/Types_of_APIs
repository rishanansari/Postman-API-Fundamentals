**Types of APIs**

Hardware APIs
Interface for software to talk to hardware.
Example: How your phone's camera talks to the operating system. 

Software Library APIs
Interface for directly consuming code from another code base.
Example: Using methods from a library you import into your application.

Web APIs
Interface for communicating across code bases over a network.
Example: Fetching current stock prices from a finance API over the internet.



Multiple API types may be used to achieve a task. For example, uploading a photo to Instagram makes use of various APIs:

Hardware API for the app to talk to your camera

Software library API for the image to be processed with filters

Web API for sending your image to Instagram's servers so your friends can like it!


Architectures
![Alt text](image-2.png)

There is more than one way to build and consume APIs. Some architecture types you may come across are:

REST (Representational State Transfer)
GraphQL
WebSockets
webhooks
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)
MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport)


REST APIs
Some traits of REST APIs include not storing session state between requests, the ability to cache, and the ability to send and receive various data types. Still confused? Don't worry; we will learn hands-on very soon in this course!

Access
APIs also vary in the scope of who can access them.

Public APIs (aka Open APIs)
Consumed by anyone who discovers the API

Private APIs
Consumed only within an organization and not made public

Partner APIs
Consumed between one or more organizations that have an established relationship
