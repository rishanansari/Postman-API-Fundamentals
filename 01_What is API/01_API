**Application Programming Interfaces**
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a contract that allows code to talk to other code. APIs are the building blocks of modern software because they allow for sharing of resources and services across applications, organizations, and devices.

Have you ever made a payment on a website? Checked the weather on a mobile app? Listened to Spotify on both your desktop and your phone? Used Google Maps inside another app? Whether you know it or not, you are using APIs every day. Even this lesson you are reading is brought to you by an API!



**Why are APIs important?**
APIs help developers integrate exciting features and build automation without reinventing the wheel
ex: using a Weather API instead of launching your weather balloons

APIs allow enterprises to open up their product for faster innovation
ex: apps that interact with Twitter or Meta APIs by posting on your behalf or reading tweets

APIs can be products themselves
ex: Software as a Service (SaaS) products like Stripe's payment APIs or Twilio's text messaging and email APIs
